soonish theme is a free and open source portfolio theme designed for PicoCMS, a flat file CMS, with the attention to file structures, layout design, web responsive feature. It is modified from a two columns one titled [simpleTwo](https://github.com/sonst-was/simpleTwo) with the following changes and new features:

1. Automatic generation of a list of markdown files within the same folder on index.md (adapt the code from [pico-femto](https://github.com/randomchars42/pico-femto))
2. Following [pico-femto](https://github.com/randomchars42/pico-femto), content/files in a folder called archive will not be listed on the navbar.
3. Only show the title of the index.md file within each folder on the navbar
4. The file with "Tag: hide" won't show in the file list generation in #1
Check against the folder directory for all sub files, and this will help to 5. mark the current location of the navbar (<<).
6. The addition of Libre Fonts
7. CSS: Animated site title (CSS), Table color, font size, color, background gradient, etc
8. Simple responsible web (with CSS)

NB: the order of the navbar is subjected to the alphabetical orders of the folders, but the order of the files within a folder will be listed according to the date order.
